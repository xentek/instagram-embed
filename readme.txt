Easily embed your Instagram photos into WordPress posts (or pages).

== Description ==

Easily embed your Instagram photos into WordPress posts (or pages) by placing the instagram url on its own line. For more control, wrap the url in the embed shortcode and pass it one of three values via the size attribute.

Shortcode Examples:

`[embed size=t]http://instagr.am/p/BsUh5/[/embed]`

`[embed size=m]http://instagr.am/p/BsUh5/[/embed]`

`[embed size=l]http://instagr.am/p/BsUh5/[/embed]`

The values t, m, or l correspond to the thumbnail, medium, and large sizes of the images. Medium is the default size.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder (after you unzip the download) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Embed some Instagram love in your posts

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Instagram? =

An iPhone (only) App that allows you to add filters to your crappy iPhone pics and turn them into some kind of digital gold. 

I don't work there, I'm just a fan. Learn more here: http://instagram.com/

= I want to wrap the image in a bunch of divs to make it easier for me to style. =

Less is more.

This plugin only outputs a simple img tag with nothing more than the class instagram-photo and a unique ID. This, in most cases, should be enough to make the embeded image(s) more malleable in the DOM, but for more advanced uses, just add a filter.

Example:

`<?php
	add_filter( 'embed_instagram', 'my_rad_instagram_filter', 10, 4 );
	function my_rad_instagram_filter( $embed, $matches, $attr, $url, $rawattr )
	{
		return '<a href="' . $url . '">' . $embed . '</a>';
	}
?>`
